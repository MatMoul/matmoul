whiptail is now fixed, archfi and archfi are still dialog based but I will add the choice between the two for next release :
 - https://pagure.io/newt/issue/22
 - https://pagure.io/newt/issue/23 

I released a new version for g810-led which fixes CVE-2022-46338 (https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46338)

I lack time to maintain g810-led, I need HELP to maintain it :

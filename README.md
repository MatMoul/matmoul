It's been a while since I was able to take care of my projects but I come back to it (As my free time is limited, I do my best).

I had to support archfi/archdi after the last popt update which decommissioned whiptail.
I migrated to dialog and I reported the problems on the newt project.
The work is in progress.

I will try to take up requests for g810-led as soon as possible but due to lack of time, we will have to wait a bit.
